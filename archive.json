Depending on the criticality, volume, or perishability of the information being protected,\r\nlonger or shorter operational lifetimes may be established for cryptographic keys. Some private-sector\r\norganizations neither change key variables and/or certificates nor make provision for users to change the keys\r\nand/or certificates. This is not recommended if the information has any privacy or security value. Ideally, an\r\norganization controls cryptoperiod determinations for the keys that protect its information.\r\n```",

One thing that caught my eye is this draft defines an identifier as a principle and not principal. The latter makes more sense to me [and a quick search confirms this is what OAuth uses](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-assertions-05), and I assume others.\r\n\r\nIs this a typo? I will be doing a quick PR shortly, replacing all use of principle with principal, which seems to be the intent and is a very easy fix (I hope).\r\n\r\nIf I misunderstood feel free to tell me so and close it.",

More discussion than issue:\r\n\r\nWhile there can be well-known public verification entities, a verifier can be very specific, perhaps personal, consisting of a collection of verifier services both public and private.  This enables a local, target-specific trust metric that yields a reputational scoring. Zero-knowledge mechanisms can provide blinded authentication and reputation calculation.\r\n\r\nAs such, Transparency Tokens could provide a basis for an agoric, reputation-based marketplace.",
